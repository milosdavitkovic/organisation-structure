- **Java 21** or later installed
- **Maven 3.6+** installed
- Basic familiarity with command-line tools

### Check Your Installation

```bash
# Verify Java version
java -version

# Verify Maven version
mvn -version
```

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source (Recommended)

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd organisation-structure
   ```

2. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Verify the build**
   ```bash
   ls target/exercise-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

### Option 2: Download Pre-built JAR

If a pre-built JAR is available, download it directly.

## ðŸ“Š Prepare Your Data

Create a CSV file with your employee data in this format:

```csv
Id,firstName,lastName,salary,managerId
123,Joe,Doe,60000,
124,Martin,Chekov,45000,123
125,Bob,Ronstad,47000,123
300,Alice,Hasacat,50000,124
305,Brett,Hardleaf,34000,300
```

**Important Notes:**
- First line is the header (will be automatically skipped)
- CEO has empty `managerId`
